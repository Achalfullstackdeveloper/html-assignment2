                <h1>MAHATMA GANDHI</h1>
                <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was also known as Mahatma, "Great Soul" Gandhi, was a hero, as well
                    as a political and spiritual leader of India. He was of the Hindu faith, of which I am too. Mohandas
                    brought India to independence by using non-violent resistance. He thought that there was injustice
                    being served to the Indians, especially to the immigrants by the South Africans. Gandhi was born on
                    October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Kathiawar, now known as Gujarat. Gandhi passed away at the age of 78
                    on January 30, 1948. Mahatma Gandhi was brought up in India near Rajkot, where he did most of his
                    studies. </p>
